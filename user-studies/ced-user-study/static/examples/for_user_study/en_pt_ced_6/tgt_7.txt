 <h-l-2>I cannot vouch for</h-l-2> Pe√±a Nieto 's democratic convictions , but , generationally , he did not grow up in a democratic Mexico : he was barely two years old during the old <h-l-1>system 's darkest moment , the student massacre of 1968 ; he was 28 in 1994 , at the time of the country 's first semi-democratic election ( which even the victor , Ernesto Zedillo , later acknowledged was free , but not fair ) ; and he turned</h-l-1> 34 in 2000 .
